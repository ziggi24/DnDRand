## DnD Random Character Generator

This project will generate a fully randomized DnD character. It is based on the DnD v1.0 character stats and classes. 
This will roll all of the player stats, then build  a character around them. It will choose starting weapons and randomly assign a last name and title to your character. 

I designed this to work in two disticnt situations. 
- Get some friends together and roll random characters. Play through with those character in a single-night DnD sesh 
- To make a randomized character sheet for NPC's during a normal DnD sesh

#### Instructions
- Git clone into the directory 
- Run python DnDGen.py 
- Input your characters first name
- The script will output a text file with the name you input
- Open, and enjoy!!
